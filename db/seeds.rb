# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
  # ["Grade 1", "Grade 2", "Grade 3", "Grade 4"].each do |genre_name|
  #   Level.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)
  # end

  # ["Father",
  #   "Mother", 
  #   "Gardian", 
  #   "Brother", 
  #   "Sister", 
  #   "Uncle", 
  #   "Auntie", 
  #   "Grand-Father", 
  #   "Grand-Mother",
  #   "Step Father",
  #   "Step Mother",
  #   "Cousin",
  #   "Other"
  # ].each do |genre_name|
  #   RelationType.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)
  # end
